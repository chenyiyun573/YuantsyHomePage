Check the code pushed by Liu Wei at branch react-1.0.0.
The page has been splited very well. 
I will save this version of code as branch 1.1.0. Then start to modify the content on my side. 


Currently, I want to use the Home Page only. Maybe I will add other pages in the future. 
For the existing Pricing, Customer, Blog, Docs, Extra button on the header of each page. 
I plan to change them to Agent, KnowledgeTree, Wiki, with defined, fixed URL of other sites. 

And for the footer, I need to use the code by Li Hang at branch react-ts-1.0.0.

History: React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
